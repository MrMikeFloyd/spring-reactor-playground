# Reactive Spring Playground

This isn't necessarily usable code, I'm just fiddling around with Spring Reactor.

## How to run

Most stuff here is unit test code that isn't backed by an actual application.

I'd recommend opening in you IDE, and running the different test cases.

## Further reading

The Reactor docs are a good place to start!
